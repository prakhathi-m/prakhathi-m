*** Glad you found me!!
Right after undergrad, I worked as a web developer thatâ€™s when I discovered my interest in developing web & mobile applications. From building websites, consuming API to building API, I stumbled, learned, and evolved. Throughout my experience, the one thing I have taken to my heart is to always think of the ways to build a reusable optimized component. I have built various Multiplatform responsive customer-facing web solutions using modern Javascript frameworks which include ReactJs, Redux, NodeJs.
